# Anagram
C program that checks if two words are anagrams of eachother. An anagram is a word that is formed by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the original letters once. The program anagram.c (compiled as the program anagram) takes two command-line arguments. It implements the anagram check on these two arguments. The program does not check whether the arguments are proper words. anagram.c returns an error code of 0 if the words are anagrams of eachother, and prints "Anagram" to the screen. Otherwise, it returns an error code of 1, and prints "Not an anagram" to the screen. The program does this once and then terminates. Usage: "./anagram WORD1 WORD2". This program was created on March 14th 2023 by Stefan Wallin.
